# YouTube Playlist Downloader Script

This script automates the process of downloading YouTube playlists as audio files. It uses `yt-dlp` to fetch and download the playlist while providing a dynamic progress bar and displaying the current song being downloaded.

## Features

- Downloads audio files from YouTube playlists.
- Displays a dynamic progress bar indicating download progress.
- Shows the name of the current song being downloaded.

- Hides unnecessary `yt-dlp` output for a cleaner user experience.

## Requirements

1. **Bash**: Ensure you have a Unix-like shell environment.
2. **yt-dlp**: Install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install yt-dlp
   ```
3. **FFmpeg**: Required for audio extraction. Install it using your systemâ€™s package manager, e.g.,:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ffmpeg  # For Debian/Ubuntu
   brew install ffmpeg      # For macOS
   ```

```bash
./script.sh [-p url] [-f file] [-h]
```

### Options

- `-p url`:
  Download a single playlist from the specified URL.

- `-f file`:
  Download multiple playlists from a file. The file should contain lines in the format:

  ```

- `-h`:

## Examples

### Download a Single Playlist

To download a playlist from a URL:

```bash
./script.sh -p "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID"
```

### Download Multiple Playlists

To download multiple playlists listed in a file:

```bash
./script.sh -f playlists.txt
```

Example `playlists.txt`:

```
MyPlaylist1 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID_1
MyPlaylist2 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID_2
```

## How It Works

1. **Playlist Fetching**:

   - The script fetches the playlist title and the total number of videos.
   - Creates a directory named after the playlist to store downloaded files.

2. **Dynamic Progress Bar**:

   - Displays a progress bar based on the number of files downloaded.
   - Shows the current song being downloaded below the progress bar.

3. **Output Management**:

   - Suppresses unnecessary `yt-dlp` output for a cleaner terminal display.

## Troubleshooting

- **yt-dlp Command Not Found**:
  Ensure `yt-dlp` is installed and available in your `PATH`.

- **FFmpeg Issues**:
  If audio extraction fails, verify that `ffmpeg` is installed and working correctly.

- **Permission Errors**:
  Ensure you have write permissions for the directory where the script is executed.
